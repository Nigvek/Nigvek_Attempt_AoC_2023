# Nigvek_Attempt_AoC_2023
My personnal attempt to do AoC 2023

All my script are written in python for the moment (maybe i will do some in golang or powershell)
All my script could contain reptition or none optimized code
My philosophy is to write script that could be maintain in the future by people with low scripting level and almost no time to spent on it like myself

Feel free to give feedback if it could fit with my philosophy :)
